                <h1>Cultural Sprint 1</h1>
                <h2>Identity, Values and Strengths Exploration</h2>
                <hr>
                <h2>Using the evidence gathered, describe your core personal
                    values.</h1>
                <h2>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision
                    to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that
                    decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you
                    took.</h2>
                <p>I had a decision to make when I got made redundant during my
                    maternity leave. I was treated unfairly while being away from the
                    organisation on maternity leave and wasnt given the chance to stand up
                    for my role while they did a restructure since I had been away from the
                    organisation for 6 months. I decided that I did not agree with how they
                    treated myself and other woman in the organisation so when I was offered
                    other positions to apply for I decline that offer as I decided it
                    went against my values to work for an organisation that treats me and other
                    people that way. It was a hard decision to weigh up as leaving the company
                    meant that we did not have my income to rely on for when I was due back  but for
                    myself and my husband it wasnt worth the extra money to go against
                    my values. The decision I made was to leave the job. The consequences
                    of this action was that I no longer had a role to return to but this
                    was a good thing as it lead me to push myself to do what I had been
                    wanting to do for a while which was to study web development.</p><br>

                <h2>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and
                    identity.</h2>
                <p>I have grown up with a very hardworking and determined
                    background. Both my parents were/are very hard working and determined people
                    and I believe that this has been passed down to me. The value of
                    manaakitanga has always been strong in my culture too. To treat other
                    people with kindness and respect. I always try to follow this value and
                    incorporate in my daily life.</p><br>

                <h2>Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and
                    limitations.</h2>
                <h2>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your
                    learning and career development</h2>

                <p>My strengths would be my determine and motivation to succeed.
                    Another strength would be my willingness to give anything a go and
                    to keep trying when things get tough. My limitations are the personal juggle
                    that I will have to do to balance family life with two small kids
                    and a husband and getting the learning and career development completed.
                    Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning
                    journeyand how they might intersect with learning obstacles.</p><br>

                <p>I
                    know that my determination and motivation to successfully
                    complete
                    this course and then move on to become a web developer will
                    definitely
                    help me to succeed. This motivation and seeing the end goal
                    will
                    help to
                    ensure that I can get past any learning obstacles that come
                    my way.

                    try
                    now, and why.</h2>
                <p>In my previous job my manager would believe that her ideas were always
                    correct and would struggle to take on other peoples ideas if they
                    werent in line with her own ideas. This caused tension and led to a
                    not very cohesive team and also stifled any forward momentum in the
                    team
                    as
                    well
                    as she had very old school ways of doing things. The
                    strategies
                    I
                    used
                    at the time were to present my ideas to her in a clear and
                    concise
                    way
                    with plenty of evidence backing them up so that she would
                    struggle
                    to
                    pick apart the idea. I would also compromise and bring in
                    her
                    ideas
                    into
                    my ideas so that it wasnt a huge change for her and that she
                    could
                    still
                    feel included while we still gained forward momentum. This
                    was
                    sometimes
                    effective but other times she did not budge from her
                    original
                    ideas.Other strategies I would try would be to get the
                    support
                    of my
                    whole team and approach it together with the support of
                    everyone. I
                    would look and see the different learning styles and
                    personality
                    styles
                    of the people I am working with and learn about how it is
                    best
                    to
                    approach each personality style e.g some people are better
                    with
                    plans
                    and written information while other people like seeing stuff
                    get
                    done
                    first and then explaining it to them afterward.</p>
