                <h1>Cultural Sprint 2</h1>
                <h2>Learning Plan</h2>
                <hr>
                <h2>LONG TERM GOAL</h2>
                <p>My
                    long term
                    goal is to get a job as a software developer. For many years
                    I
                    have sacrificed my career for other aspects of life and
                    ended up
                    in jobs that I havent been satisfied in and also jobs that I
                    havent been appreciated in. My goal is to get a job that is
                    flexible and gives me that job satisfaction.</p>


                <h2>SKILLS TO DEVELOP</h2>
                <p>Organisation skills. Not so
                    much my life organisation as I feel like I am good at that.
                    But
                    organising the smaller details like folders and emails.</p>
                <h2> STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS</h2>
                <p>My strengths would have to be my motivation to achieve this
                    goal. I have both my own self to achieve for as well as my
                    family so my motivation level is definitely very high.
                    Another strength is my time management skills. Having two
                    young
                    kids and already fitting in two hours of study a day as well
                    as
                    general household chores has made me learn to be very good
                    at
                    time management.
                    Another strength is my support network. My husband is
                    fantastic.
                    Not only is he as excited as me for me to be doing this
                    course
                    but he has also taken on extra tasks around the house and
                    will
                    be taking on the majority of child wrangling during the
                    bootcamp. He is also a great support as he is a software
                    developer himself so is there to help if I have any
                    questions
                    but also encourages me to push myself and is helping me set
                    myself up for the future career. E.g he wont just tell me
                    the
                    answer but help me realise how to google for it myself etc.
                    My limitations is my organisational skills when it comes to
                    the
                    finer details like organiser folders on a computer or emails
                    etc.
                    Another limitation which can also be a strength is that I am
                    not
                    a perfectionist often I will be satisfied to get things to
                    MVP
                    and then I am ready to move on. I believe this can
                    definitely be
                    a limitation but can also see that it is a strength.
                    Another of my limitations is that I often get a bit put off
                    if I
                    get stuck on a problem. I have been working very hard lately
                    to
                    make sure that I power through until I find a solution.</p>
                <h2>COMMITMENTS</h2>
                <p>I am commited to completing this course and gaining as much
                    technical and core skills as I possibly can.</p>

                <p>If I come across a problem I cant solve. I will seek help
                    from my own cohort to see if anyone else
                    knows
                    the answer. This will help everyone else learn as well and
                    help
                    if someone else has a similar problem to me. I will also
                    seek
                    help from the facilitation team. I will also seek help from
                    my
                    husband. And I will also google the answer to get used to
                    that way of working. </p>

                <p> I look forward to having the support and passion from the
                    faciliation team both towards myself and my learning path
                    and also towards my fellow cohort. </p>


                <h2>SCHEDULING.</h2>

                <p>For the foundation course I have my daughter at home with me
                    all
                    day so I tend to do study in the evenings or her lunch nap.
                    During the
                    weekend I
                    usually spend most of my time with the family but my husband
                    will take the kids for a few hours during the day so I can
                    get
                    some uninterrupted study. Then also at night as well. I
                    realise juggling the kids and this course will be one of my
                    biggest challenges but with the support from my husband and
                    family and friends I believe I can do it. I am
                    away
                    in Rarotonga from the 14–18th September. I will make sure
                    that I am ahead of my workload before I head away for these
                    5 days.</p><br><p>
                    During the bootcamp I would love to still make it home
                    occasionally to see the kids before bedtime but myself and
                    my
                    husband do realise that this will not happen every night and
                    that some weekends will be taken up as well.
