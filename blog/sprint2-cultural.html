      <h1>Cultural Sprint 2</h1>
      <h2>Learning Plan</h2>
      <hr />
      <h2>LONG TERM GOAL</h2>
      <p>
        My long term goal is to get a job as a software developer. For many
        years I have sacrificed my career for other aspects of life and ended
        up in jobs that I havent been satisfied in and also jobs that I havent
        been appreciated in. My goal is to get a job that is flexible and
        gives me that job satisfaction.
      </p>

      <h2>SKILLS TO DEVELOP</h2>
      <p>
        Organisation skills. Not so much my life organisation as I feel like I
        am good at that. But organising the smaller details like folders and
        emails.
      </p>
      <h2>STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS</h2>
      <p>
        My strengths would have to be my motivation to achieve this goal. I
        have both my own self to achieve for as well as my family so my
        motivation level is definitely very high. Another strength is my time
        management skills. Having two young kids and already fitting in two
        hours of study a day as well as general household chores has made me
        learn to be very good at time management. Another strength is my
        support network. My husband is fantastic. Not only is he as excited as
        me for me to be doing this course but he has also taken on extra tasks
        around the house and will be taking on the majority of child wrangling
        during the bootcamp. He is also a great support as he is a software
        developer himself so is there to help if I have any questions but also
        encourages me to push myself and is helping me set myself up for the
        future career. E.g he wont just tell me the answer but help me realise
        how to google for it myself etc. My limitations is my organisational
        skills when it comes to the finer details like organiser folders on a
        computer or emails etc. Another limitation which can also be a
        strength is that I am not a perfectionist often I will be satisfied to
        get things to MVP and then I am ready to move on. I believe this can
        definitely be a limitation but can also see that it is a strength.
        Another of my limitations is that I often get a bit put off if I get
        stuck on a problem. I have been working very hard lately to make sure
        that I power through until I find a solution.
      </p>
      <h2>COMMITMENTS</h2>
      <p>
        I am commited to completing this course and gaining as much technical
        and core skills as I possibly can.
      </p>

      <p>
        If I come across a problem I cant solve. I will seek help from my own
        cohort to see if anyone else knows the answer. This will help everyone
        else learn as well and help if someone else has a similar problem to
        me. I will also seek help from the facilitation team. I will also seek
        help from my husband. And I will also google the answer to get used to
        that way of working.
      </p>

      <p>
        I look forward to having the support and passion from the faciliation
        team both towards myself and my learning path and also towards my
        fellow cohort.
      </p>

      <h2>SCHEDULING.</h2>

      <p>
        For the foundation course I have my daughter at home with me all day
        so I tend to do study in the evenings or her lunch nap. During the
        weekend I usually spend most of my time with the family but my husband
        will take the kids for a few hours during the day so I can get some
        uninterrupted study. Then also at night as well. I realise juggling
        the kids and this course will be one of my biggest challenges but with
        the support from my husband and family and friends I believe I can do
        it. I am away in Rarotonga from the 14–18th September. I will make
        sure that I am ahead of my workload before I head away for these 5
        days.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        During the bootcamp I would love to still make it home occasionally to
        see the kids before bedtime but myself and my husband do realise that
        this will not happen every night and that some weekends will be taken
        up as well.

      <h1>Updated...</h1>
      <h2>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway? What are you hoping to use the skills you gain during this
        course
        for? What sort of impact would you like to make once you leave Dev Academy? Do you have a destination in mind?
      </h2>
      <h3>I would still like to get a job as a software developer. I would like to learn a bit more about programming
        first
        to
        know exactly what kind I would like to be.</h3>
      <h2>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp? Re-evaluate your strengths and
        limitations
        from Sprint 2. Has your idea of these changed over the course of Foundations? Have you discovered any new ones
        during
        this course? How do you think these will help/hinder you during Bootcamp?</h2>
      <h3>After doing the foundation course I can see that a big limitation will be my organisational skills when it
        comes
        to
        organising folders and files on my computer. A strength is now the ability for myself to see that I can actually
        learn
        this stuff even if it may take a while. </h3>
      <h2>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h2>
      <h3>It will definitely be prioritising family and the course. </h3>
      <h2>While you will face many technical challenges on Bootcamp, this is not what we would like you to consider in
        this
        Plan.
        Non-technical challenges might include staying on top of the material, working in groups, speaking in front of
        the
        group, or keeping focused for 9 weeks, etc.


        What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h2>
      <h3>I would like to develop the skill of working in groups as I wanted to get ahead of the material since I was
        going
        away
        and so I didnt do the calculator challenge in a pair which meant I missed out on seeing how I work with others
        in a
        technical environment. </h3>
      <h2>At Dev Academy we have a large focus around human skills and improving yourself. Based on your
        strengths/limitations,
        what are some areas for development you would like to work on?
        For example, this could be things around communication, teamwork within groups, pairing with others, giving and
        receiving feedback, developing some leadership skills, or improving your self awareness and reflective skills.
      </h2>
      <h3>I would like to work on improving my reflective skills as I think this is important for understanding the
        technical
        content as well as improving myself</h3>
      <h2>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?
        That they will push me to succeed and instead of just giving the answers help me find out how I can figure out
        the
        answer. </h2>
      <h2>What does support look like to you? Keep in mind, this may not be the same as the Bootcamp team's
        expectations,
        but it
        is useful to voice these expectations.</h2>
      <h3>Being there if I have any questions about technical or core things. </h3>
      <h2>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp
        That I give it my all as I and my family are giving up quite a bit for me to do this. </h2>
      <h2>Based on your knowledge of Bootcamp, how and where will you seek help in a timely way?</h2>
      <h3>I will seek help from my cohort to see if anyone knows the answer. I will also ask the facilitators for help
        as
        well. </h3>
      <h2>Write down a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include - an
        explanation
        of
        how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and
        industry/community
        representatives.</h2>
      <h3>I am committed to working hard and focussing on the task and plan that I have laid out. I will ensure that I
        do
        have
        break times and relaxing time so that I dont completely burn out and have time to reflect on what I have learnt.
      </h3>
