                <h1>An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS
                </h1>
                <p> HTML and CSS are like the elements in a kids picture book.
                    The
                    HTML is the words on the page, the written text that the
                    reader
                    will read aloud. While the CSS is the elements on the page
                    that
                    make the picture book look pretty. It is the headings on the
                    pages, the styling of the pictures and the colouring of the
                    book.</p><br>

                <h1> Explain control flow and loops using an example process
                    from
                    everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your
                    teeth'.
                    (But not those ones).</h1>

                <p>The control flow is the order in which the computer executes
                    the
                    code. Code is run from the first line to the last line,
                    unless
                    the computer runs across the structures like loops and
                    conditionals that change the control flow
                    An everyday example of this is a person will read a book
                    from
                    the beginning to end unless something in the book tells the
                    person that they should check out different parts of the
                    book
                    first.<br>
                    Loops are a way to complete a process over and over again
                    until
                    a desired end point. An example of a loop in everyday life
                    is
                    walking. You move your left leg, then your right leg and
                    repeat
                    this over and over again until you reach your specified
                    destination.</p>

                <h1> Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might
                    interact with it.</h1>

                <p> DOM stands for Document Object Model. It is a programming
                    interface for HTML that represents an HTML page in a logical
                    tree structure like this.</p><br>
                <img src="../styles/images/DOM.gif" alt="dom tree">
                <p><br>It includes all the headers, nodes
                    and
                    objects on the page:
                    You can interact with the DOM in the DevTools. You can
                    select
                    the nodes and change the appearance of them as such:
                    Before:</p>
                <br>
                <img src="../styles/images/screenshot2.png" alt="dom">
                <p>




                    After:</p>
                <br>
                <img src="../styles/images/screenshot1.png" alt="dom"><p><br>
                    You can page around with the elements on the DOM to make
                    your friends think that a webpage is giving away free stuff
                </p>

                <h1>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays
                    and
                    objects.</h1>

                <p>With arrays you use the indexes. You do this by using
                    bracket
                    notation []. As with strings and other Javascript elements
                    you
                    begin the count with 0. Therefore the first element in the
                    element is access with [0] and the second is accessed with
                    [1]
                    etc.</p><br>

                <img src="../styles/images/array.png" alt="array"><p><br>

                    With objects you use bracket and dot notation to access the
                    data. Dot notation is what you use when you know the name of
                    the
                    property you want to access.
                </p><br>

                <img src="../styles/images/array2.png" alt="array"><p><br>
                    You mainly use bracket notation [] when the property you
                    are
                    trying to access has a space in its name
                </p><br>

                <img src="../styles/images/array3.png" alt="array">

                <h1>
                    Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</h1>
                <p>A function is a set of code designed to perform a
                    particular
                    task. A function lets you define a block of code, give
                    it a
                    name
                    and then execute it as many times as you want. A
                    function
                    can
                    look like this: </p><br>

                <img src="../styles/images/function.png" alt="function"><p><br>
                    to call the function you put the value you want
                    to
                    run
                    in the function inside the brackets after the function
                    name.
                    <br><br>

                    They are useful as they make a set of code reusable. You
                    can
                    define the function and use it multiple times to produce
                    different results. This helps code to be DRY (do not
                    repeat
                    yourself) and therefore easier to read.</p>
