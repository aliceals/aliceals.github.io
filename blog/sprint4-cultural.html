                <h1>Research Neuroplasticity</h1>

                <img src="../styles/images/brain.jpeg" alt="brain">

                <h2>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity
                    benefits people</h2>

                <p> Understanding the principles of neuroplasticity can help
                    people
                    realise what they can achieve if they practice, practice,
                    practice. It gives people the motivation to know that if
                    they
                    put in the effort they will be able to master a skill. It
                    helps
                    to boast the morale of people who are learning a new skill
                    especially those who are currently failing at it. It also
                    helps
                    to focus the learning on what will help. E.g step away from
                    rote
                    learning and instead focus on activities that make use of
                    exisiting pathways to help learn the new skill.</p>


                <h2>Discuss how might engage with the principals of
                    neuroplasticity
                    for your own benefit</h2>

                <p> Neuroplasticity will benefit me hugely in learning new
                    skills
                    and information. The repetition principle will help me learn
                    coding with repeating the skills over and over my brain will
                    become more familiar with them. Also transference will help
                    where learning one skill or language will help learn another
                    computer skill.</p>

                <h2> What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity</h2>
                <p> Practice, practice, practice. I will try to do a bit of
                    study
                    every day to keep my mind focussed on the task and build
                    thicker
                    neural pathways. Setting goals will help increase my
                    neuroplasticity. Also getting good rest in when I can (a bit
                    of
                    a challenge with two small kids). And also practicing
                    mindfulness. </p>

                <h1> Research Growth Mindset</h1>

                <img src="../styles/images/growth.png" alt="brain">

                <h2>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant</h2>

                <p>When people believe they can achieve something they are more
                    likely to be able to achieve it. This is relevant for
                    learning
                    new skills and also relevant for me in this course as if I
                    have
                    this mindset then I will be more likely to handle harder
                    challenges better and be more likely to succeed.</p>
                <h2> In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for
                    you?</h2>
                <p>I feel like I was aware of this before the exploration.
                    However,
                    it has made me think more about it in relation to doing this
                    course. It has highlighted the fact that having this mindset
                    will help me in this course and has made me mindful that
                    when I
                    doubt myself if a challenge is hard I should try to change
                    my
                    mindset to believe that I will be able to achieve it.</p>
                <h2> How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning
                    journey?</h2>

                <p> I will believe that I will get to the point where I will be
                    able
                    to computer programme and this will help me reach the goal.
                    When
                    I reach a task that I am struggling with I will try not to
                    doubt
                    my ability to achieve the result but acknowledge that I will
                    get
                    there in the end. I will also change my thinking from "I
                    cant do
                    it", to "I cant do it, yet"</p>

                    influence your learning plan and strategy.</h2>

                <p>I will try to fit in some time to practice mindfulness so
                    that I
                    can focus on positive thinking and help develop a growth
                    mindset. I will also ensure that I dont have too much of a
                    break
                    between days of study so that I can build the best and
                    strongest
                    neural pathways</p>
