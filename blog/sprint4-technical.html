            <h2>Problem</h2>

            <p>
                <br>A problem I got stuck on was in the Katas with the Gradebook challenge. I got stuck as I couldnt
                access the information in the object using the dot notation like I usually do so I couldnt get the
                solution to work.

            <h2>Solution</h2>

            <p>
                <br>I ended up figuring it out by first console.logging out to see what I was currently getting. This
                showed me that what I was using to try to access the information in the object wasnt working as it was
                logging out undefined. Then I went back and reread the information in the guide and saw that it hinted
                at the fact that some properties needed bracket notation. Then I googled how to use bracket notation to
                remind myself how to do that again. I learnt to read the instructions properly before starting a
                challenge as there might be some handy information in there that I might miss.

            <h2>Techniques </h2>

            <img src="../styles/images/debug.jpeg" alt="debug">

            <p>
                <br><u>Pseudocode</u> - I find pseudocode a great idea but Im not that good at using it. I tend to jump
                right into the problem or brainstorm on a piece of paper. I would like to get better at doing
                this.<br><br>
                <u>Trying something</u> - I tend to try multiple things to try to get the solution working<br><br>
                <u>Rubber ducky method</u> - I havent given this method a go yet but I have often figured out the
                solution as Im am explaining the problem when asking for help<br><br>
                <u>Reading error messages</u> - I see this as an important technique and a useful one for me. I try to
                use this as my first step in problem solving.<br><br>
                <u>Console.logging</u> - I use console.logging quite a bit to see where the problem is and help find the
                solution<br><br>
                <u>Googling</u> - I find that I am always googling to help find the answers<br><br>
                <u>Asking your peers for help</u> - I need to get better at this. I think once bootcamp starts I might
                use this more.<br><br>
                <u>Asking coaches for help</u> - My husband is a great help. He doesnt give me the solution but instead
                guides me to how I can solve it myself.<br><br>
                <u>Improving your process with reflection</u> - I think this is an important part of helping with future
                problem solving.
