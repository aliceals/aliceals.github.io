            <h1>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?
            </h1>
            <h2> 1. That often my first response is that I cant do something and that I need to change this.<br> 
                2. That I need to take some time out in busy life and spend it reflecting. <br>
                3. That I work best when I have a set plan to follow. <br></h2>
            <h1>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h1>
            <h2>How important it is in the learning process. How the more you understand about yourself and the core
                learning the easier
                it is to learn the technical stuff. </h2>
            <h1>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h1>
            <h2>The most challenging part was trying to prioritise the core learning part. I would often get more
                interested
                and excited
                about the technical skills as they seems more "important" but when I actually looked into the core
                skills I
                realised how
                important they were as well.</h2>
            <h1>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web
                development
                bootcamp course?</h1>
            <h2>To make us more employable to prospective employers. Also to help us learn better by understanding how
                we
                learn best. </h2>
            <h1>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used
                that time to
                practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.</h1>
            <h2>I did struggle at the start to understand the need for so much of it but I do think it is important to
                touch
                on this
                stuff to help us learn better in the future.</h2>
